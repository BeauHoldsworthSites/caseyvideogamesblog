<p>I logged onto the game and guess what i fell under the sea. and tried to find a ship in the middle of that i unlocked a new character i didn't take note of his name. Then i earned 500 coins that i collected from the lego floor. Then he travelled to a prison it seemed like. At that point it was one of them story video things where it explains your new place in the game your playing.</p>
